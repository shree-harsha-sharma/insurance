                    <p class="lead mb-0">Endowment plan is a life insurance policy which provides you with a combination of both i.e.: an insurance cover, as well as an savings plan. It helps you in saving regularly over a specific period of time, so that you are able to get a lump sum amount on policy maturity, if the policyholder survives the policy term.</p>
                   
                </div>
            </div>
            <p class="lead mb-0">The policyholder gets his/her sum assured on a fixed date in future as per the policy terms and conditions. However, in case of sudden death of the policyholder, the insurance company will pay the sum assured (plus the bonus, if any) to the nominee of the policy. Besides, it is also useful to secure yourself or your family post-retirement or to meet various financial needs such as funding for children's education and/or marriage or buying a house.</p><br />
